Both the PPTX and PDF version of the final presentation (given on 4/30/2025). 

Feedback will be recieved shortly that I will probably add here just so I have it. It was my first time presenting 16S data like that so I think I amde some mistakes, but overall am proud of myself. 

Unfortunately this analysis was more difficult than I expected because I wish there was more. Reflecting on the projecct, I should've read the paper better, I should've checked the metadata better, and I should've proactively thought about the purpose of the study and the biological meaning. It was harder than I expected to pull together an 8 minute presentation focusing on the biological impact when most of the time was spent on methods, vocabulary and work flow. I think it is a testiment to being so narrow minded in the analysis and a reminder to think big picture since we are biologists! Some huge take aways for my own 16S analysis.
