Welcome to the README.md file nestled within my code/ folder!

This is a small but might home to TWO R-scripts. 

One is colors.R which is where we can find "cheese_type" sorting the four different types of cheeses in this study to colors used in the analysis to visually identify who is who. Coloring our figures this way allows for easy changes to be made if requested without potentially causing errors in analysis. There is also "phylum_colors" which is where the phyla identified in the cheese samples were colored differently for stacked bar plot purposes. 

The second file is functions.R. This is where the scalling function we used can be foud and is a piece of intellectual property of our professor, Mar! Instead of rarefying our read depth, we scaled which should *spoiler does* give almost identical read depths across samples. In this data set is was the minimum read depth + 3 for the maximum thanks to the "matround" function nestled within this file.
