# milk-cheese-analysis
Welcome to my BIOMI 6300 Amplicon Sequencing Project. 

I will be analyzing data from this paper, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643821007325 looking at 16S RNA sequencing data from milk and cheese in Brazil. I will be focusing on just the cheese analysis, but hope to do the milk analysis at a later time to practice my understanding of statistical power of different samples. 

There are two research questions I will be looking to answer through my analysis. 

  1) Does cheese type influence microbial community composition? and...
  2) Are those differences only visible at finer taxonomic scales?

My broad scale hypothesis I will be testing statistically is:
    H0: Cheese type does not influence microbial community composition.
    HA: Cheese type does influence microbial community composition. 

Brielfy, the premise of the paper, per the authors, is to characterize microbial communities of cheese from sheep of Lacaune breed, produced in the South Region of Brazil. The goal of this research is to contribute to knowledge about sheeps cheese. This paper uses Illumina MiSeq paired-end v2 500-cycles kit (2 x 250 bp) sequencing the V3-V4 region with the standard F515 to R806 primers. 

Throughout this analysis, you will be able to track chronologically through the analysis with interpretations and detail code to follow along the analysis or understand why certain decisions were made. 

Happy reading!
