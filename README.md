# milk-cheese-analysis
Welcome to my BIOMI 6300 Amplicon Sequencing Project. 

I will be analyzing data from this paper, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643821007325 looking at 16S RNA sequencing data from milk and cheese in Brazil. I will be focusing on just the cheese analysis for now, but hope to do the milk analysis at a later time to practice my understanding of statistical power of different samples.
