READ ME! I am the keeper of all things related to this analysis...hence my location, in the **analysis/** folder😁😆

Every .Rmd file is knitted to a corresponding .html file. Analysis progresses in this order...

  00_FastQC
  01_QualityTrimming
  02_Assigning ASVs
  03_PreProcessing
  04A_Phylogenetic_Tree_Construction
  04B_Phylogenetic_Tree_Inspection
  05_Biodiversity
  06_Ordination
  07_Composition

Outputs from each step correspond to properly labeled folders nested within **data/** or **figures/**. 

There should be detailed interpretations or justifications as to reasoning and decisons made throughout the work flow and active coding throughout the r-chunks.
